Recipe-sharing platforms are popular for discovering and sharing new recipes, but they often lack the engaging features seen on social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram.
While these recipe sites offer structured browsing, they donâ€™t provide the dynamic, community-driven experience of social media. TikTok and Instagram excel in user
engagement, but their recipe discovery features are limited, lacking advanced filtering options for ingredients, meal types, or dietary preferences.
This project aims to combine the best of both worlds by offering a swipe-based recipe discovery system similar to social media platforms while incorporating robust filtering and
search features. Users will be able to share recipes, explore content, and leave reviews and ratings, providing valuable feedback and building a sense of community.
By blending the social interaction of platforms like TikTok and Instagram with the functionality of dedicated recipe sites, this project will create a user-friendly, engaging
environment for modern recipe enthusiasts. Success will be evaluated based on user feedback, engagement, and system performance, focusing on search and filtering
effectiveness, the impact of reviews, and overall reliability.

Features:
  -Main Feature(Recipe sharing & reviewing): The platform enables recipe sharing, commenting, and rating.
  -Dynamic Recipe Discovery: A swipe-based system, inspired by TikTok and Instagram, allows users to discover recipes in a fun and interactive manner.
  -Advanced Filtering: Users can perform detailed searches and filter recipes by ingredients, meal types, dietary preferences and ratings.
  -Recipe Bookmarking and Collections: Let users save their favorite recipes into personal collections or boards for easy access and organization. 
  -User Profiles and Follow System: Enable users to create profiles, follow their favorite chefs or fellow users, and receive updates on new recipe posts or reviews. Users can see other profiles
                                    recipe and review history.
  -Shopping List Integration: Allow users to automatically generate shopping lists based on selected recipes. For example if a recipe contains ingredients like dough, milk and sugar if user
                              wanted to create a shopping list they will just need to press one button and it will create a list of ingredients with a checkbox next to them. Users will be able to 
                              add/delete items as they wish.
